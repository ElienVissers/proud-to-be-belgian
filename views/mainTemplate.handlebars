<h1>Save Belgian Fries!</h1>
<h2>Sign our petition to register Belgian Fries as UNESCO World Heritage</h2>
<p>You've probably heard about French fries, right? But what about Belgian fries? Did you know that the "fries culture" is officially recognised as Belgian Heritage? Belgium currently has over 4600 "frietkoten" where you can buy traditional Belgian Fries. That's one for every 2500 Belgians, and it shows that Belgians take their fries very, very seriously. Belgian Fries are fried two times: once on 145°C and then again on 180°C to acquire their golden yellow color. The fries are traditionally eaten with mayonnaise and an assortiment of fried meat. For more information, visit Belgium's national "fries culture" website, which, like all things in Belgium, has an unnecessarily complicated name: <a href="http://www.navefri-unafri.be/">www.navefri-unafri.be</a></p>
<p>It's time to show the world that fries aren't just a side dish! Sign our petition to help raise awareness, register Belgian Fries as UNESCO World Heritage and safe the Belgian Fries! #MakeFriesBelgianAgain</p>
